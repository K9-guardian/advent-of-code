Solutions in SWI-Prolog.

Usage: All days require `library(func)` and `library(reif)`.
To get `library(func)` and `library(reif)`, execute the following in `swipl` and choose an install location.
```prolog
pack_install(reif).
pack_install(func).
```
Some days also use `library(edcg)`.
```prolog
pack_install(edcg).
```
